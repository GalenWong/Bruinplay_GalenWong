## BruinPlay

### Dependency
- node.js required

### What I have made:

#### Overview:

I have created a SoundCloud-like web application that stores songs (MP3 files, song metadata, album artwork, etc.) in a database and presents these songs to a client (user). The client can also listen to any of the songs in the database, and can add or delete songs. This is my final project, so I apply everything that you’ve taught me this quarter!

#### Functionalities Required for Certificate:

- Display all currently existing songs, along with their metadata (artist and title only, otherwise it looks ugly) ✅ 
- Add a new song (to server/database) and update website accordingly. ✅ 
- Delete a song (from server/database) and update website accordingly. ✅ 
- Play, pause, and seek audio player. ✅ 
- Show an “Albums” view. ✅ 

#### Additional Functionality:

- Show a history of songs that have been listened to. ✅ 
  > History of songs will be kept as long as the server is not shut down
- You can skip to next song if you want to ✅ 
- The songs will keep playing in loop ✅  
- You can pause/resume a song using spacebar ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ 
- Filter by album, artist ✅ 
- When no audio image/ album cover is provided, a default cover will be displayed ✅ 
- In the upload page, you can upload a song by providing a url from youtube (illegel but super cool) ✅ ✅ 
- Deleting a song will wipe out the record in the database, meaning the songs will be gone forever ✅ 
- Uploading a song makes it stay, songs will still be there even when server is shut down ✅ 
- Search for a song. ✅
